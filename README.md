### About Me üì∞

Data-driven researcher passionate about collaboration, innovation, and leveraging machine learning to solve complex problems in healthcare. I contribute to cutting-edge projects at the NERVES Lab and the Utah NeuroRobotics Lab at the University of Utah. I have designed wireless sEMG chips and MATLAB programs to process body-worn sensor signals automatically. I have worked with complex machine learning systems for neuroprosthesis. Currently working to create a system that uses methods from reinforcement learning to predict real-time gait transitions over difficult terrain in Python. Seeking opportunities to develop my expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to drive impactful research through collaborative endeavors.
